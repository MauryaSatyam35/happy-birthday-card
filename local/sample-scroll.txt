“The night is long, Zeya, and the walls remember.
They’ve heard the cries you never let anyone see.
I know you’ve carried scars no one else noticed, the kind that do not bleed but burn in silence.
I know the weight, the strictness, the cages built around you.
I know you’ve pretended to be fine when you were breaking.

But listen—tonight is different.
Tonight the clock strikes eighteen.
And with that number, a door creaks open.
Behind it, shadows crawl, candles flicker, voices whisper your name.
It looks like horror, it feels like terror, but hidden inside is something else… freedom.

The trauma didn’t destroy you.
You survived every scream, every silence, every moment you thought you couldn’t.
And now the ghosts of your past can only watch you step forward.

Yes, one day the final shadow will come for all of us.
But not tonight.
Tonight belongs to you.

So walk through this haunted year, unafraid.
Laugh so loudly the demons cover their ears.
Live so brightly the monsters retreat to the corners.
And know this: you are not alone in the dark.
I am here, and I want nothing but your real happiness — not the mask, not the pretend, the real thing.

Happy 18th Birthday, Zeya.
May your shadows fade, and your story turn brighter than the night that shaped you.”
